"It has been a long day, and I have not eaten.""But how do we cross the river?" "I can't swim," said the fox.The elephant said, "I will carry you on my back."The elephant carried the fox on his back and crossed the river. Together, they went to the sugarcane field. The fox ate quickly and got full, but the elephant's stomach did not get full. The full-bellied fox was mesmerized and howled loudly with joy."Don't shout loudly; if anyone hears, they will come and beat both of them," said the elephant. But the fox did not listen to the elephant. Hearing the fox's shout, the owner of the farm came.The fox ran fast and escaped the blows. But the elephant was heavy and big, so it could not escape the owner's blows. He hit the elephant hard. The elephant somehow escaped from him and came across the field.Written bySam Samson Rajalbanda89 followers·26 followingHi Everyone, welcome to my world.
